             <br>
             <div class="text">
           The Air Quality Index (AQI) is used for reporting daily air quality. It tells you how clean or
polluted your air is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for you. The AQI
focuses on health effects you may experience within a few hours or days after breathing
polluted air. EPA calculates the AQI for five major air pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act:
ground-level ozone, particle pollution (also known as particulate matter), carbon monoxide,
sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. For each of these pollutants, EPA has established national
air quality standards to protect public health .Ground-level ozone and airborne particles are the
two pollutants that pose the greatest threat to human health in this country.

  		     <div class="texth">How is air polluted:</div>
             <br>
             <div class="text">
1. Burning of Fossil Fuels: Sulfur dioxide emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels like coal,
petroleum and other factory combustibles is one the major cause of air pollution. Pollution
emitting from vehicles including trucks, jeeps, cars, trains, airplanes cause immense amount of
pollution. We rely on them to fulfill our daily basic needs of transportation. But, there overuse
is killing our environment as dangerous gases are polluting the environment. Carbon
Monooxide caused by improper or incomplete combustion and generally emitted from vehicles
is another major pollutant along with Nitrogen Oxides, that is produced from both natural and
man made processes.
<br> <br>
2. Agricultural activities: Ammonia is a very common by product from agriculture related
activities and is one of the most hazardous gases in the atmosphere. Use of insecticides,
pesticides and fertilizers in agricultural activities has grown quite a lot. They emit harmful
chemicals into the air and can also cause water pollution.
<br> <br>
3. Exhaust from factories and industries: Manufacturing industries release large amount of
carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, organic compounds, and chemicals into the air thereby
depleting the quality of air. Manufacturing industries can be found at every corner of the earth
and there is no area that has not been affected by it. Petroleum refineries also release
hydrocarbons and various other chemicals that pollute the air and also cause land pollution.
<br> <br>
4. Mining operations: Mining is a process wherein minerals below the earth are extracted using
large equipments. During the process dust and chemicals are released in the air causing
massive air pollution. This is one of the reason which is responsible for the deteriorating health
conditions of workers and nearby residents.
<br> <br>
5. Indoor air pollution: Household cleaning products, painting supplies emit toxic chemicals in
the air and cause air pollution. Have you ever noticed that once you paint walls of your house, it
creates some sort of smell which makes it literally impossible for you to breathe.
Suspended particulate matter popular by its acronym SPM, is another cause of pollution.
Referring to the particles afloat in the air, SPM is usually caused by dust, combustion etc.

  		     <div class="texth">Effects of Air Pollution</div>
             <br>
             <div class="text"> 
1. Respiratory and heart problems: The effects of Air pollution are alarming. They are known to
create several respiratory and heart conditions along with Cancer, among other threats to the
body. Several millions are known to have died due to direct or indirect effects of Air pollution.
Children in areas exposed to air pollutants are said to commonly suffer from pneumonia and
asthma.
<br> <br>
2. Global warming: Another direct effect is the immediate alterations that the world is
witnessing due to Global warming. With increased temperatures world wide, increase in sea
levels and melting of ice from colder regions and icebergs, displacement and loss of habitat
have already signaled an impending disaster if actions for preservation and normalization aren’t
undertaken soon.
<br> <br>
3. Acid Rain: Harmful gases like nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides are released into the
atmosphere during the burning of fossil fuels. When it rains, the water droplets combines with
these air pollutants, becomes acidic and then falls on the ground in the form of acid rain. Acid
rain can cause great damage to human, animals and crops.
<br> <br>
4. Eutrophication: Eutrophication is a condition where high amount of nitrogen present in some
pollutants gets developed on sea’s surface and turns itself into algae and and adversely affect
fish, plants and animal species. The green colored algae that is present on lakes and ponds is
due to presence of this chemical only.
<br> <br>
5. Effect on Wildlife: Just like humans, animals also face some devastating affects of air
pollution. Toxic chemicals present in the air can force wildlife species to move to new place and
change their habitat. The toxic pollutants deposit over the surface of the water and can also
affect sea animals.
<br> <br>
6. Depletion of Ozone layer: Ozone exists in earth’s stratosphere and is responsible for
protecting humans from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. Earth’s ozone layer is depleting due to
the presence of chlorofluorocarbons, hydro chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere. As ozone
layer will go thin, it will emit harmful rays back on earth and can cause skin and eye related
problems. UV rays also have the capability to affect crops.
<br> <br>
When you try to study the sources of Air pollution, you enlist a series of activities and
interactions that create these pollutants. There are two types of sources that we will take a look
at: Natural sources and Man-made sources.
<br> <br>
Natural sources of pollution include dust carried by the wind from locations with very little or
no green cover, gases released from the body processes of living beings (Carbon dioxide from
humans during respiration, Methane from cattle during digestion, Oxygen from plants during
Photosynthesis). Smoke from the combustion of various inflammable objects, volcanic
eruptions etc along with the emission of polluted gases also make it to the list of Natural
sources of Pollution.
<br> <br>
While looking at the man-made contributions towards air pollution, smoke again features as a
prominent component. The smoke emitted from various forms of combustion like in bio mass,
factories, vehicles, furnaces etc. Waste used to create landfills generate methane, that is
harmful in several ways. The reactions of certain gases and chemicals also form harmful fumes
that can be dangerous to the well being of living creatures.

  		     <div class="texth">Solution to Air Pollution</div>
             <br>
             <div class="text">
1. Use public mode of transportation: Encourage people to use more and more public modes of
transportation to reduce pollution. Also, try to make use of car pooling. If you and your
colleagues come from the same locality and have same timings you can explore this option to
save energy and money.
<br> <br>
2. Conserve energy: Switch off fans and lights when you are going out. Large amount of fossil
fuels are burnt to produce electricity. You can save the environment from degradation by
reducing the amount of fossil fuels to be burned.
<br> <br>
3. Understand the concept of Reduce, Reuse and Recycle: Do not throw away items that are of
no use to you. In-fact reuse them for some other purpose. For e.g. you can use old jars to store
cereals or pulses.
<br> <br>
4. Emphasis on clean energy resources: Clean energy technologies like solar, wind and
geothermal are on high these days. Governments of various countries have been providing
grants to consumers who are interested in installing solar panels for their home. This will go a
long way to curb air pollution.
<br> <br>
5. Use energy efficient devices: CFL lights consume less electricity as against their counterparts.
They live longer, consume less electricity, lower electricity bills and also help you to reduce
pollution by consuming less energy.
<br> <br>
Several attempts are being made world wide on a personal, industrial and governmental levels
to curb the intensity at which Air Pollution is rising and regain a balance as far as the
proportions of the foundation gases are concerned. This is a direct attempt at slacking Global
warming. We are seeing a series of innovations and experiments aimed at alternate and
unconventional options to reduce pollutants. Air Pollution is one of the larger mirrors of man’s
follies, and a challenge we need to overcome to see a tomorrow.
